B
Define the common ion effect in the behavior of weak bases and provide an example.
The decrease in solubility of a weak base caused by the addition of a common ion; e.g., NH3 + NH4Cl
The increase in solubility of a strong base due to the addition of a common ion; e.g., NaOH + NaCl
The enhancement of ionization of weak bases in the presence of a common ion; e.g., CH3NH2 + CH3NH4NO3
The absence of any effect on weak bases by the addition of a common ion
